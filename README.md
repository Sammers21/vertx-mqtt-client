# Vert.x MQTT client

This component provides an [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) client which is compliant with the 3.1.1 spec. Its API provides a bunch of methods for connecting/disconnecting to a broker, publishing messages (with all three different levels of QoS) and subscribing to topics.

**Note: This module has Tech Preview status, this means the API can change between versions.**
